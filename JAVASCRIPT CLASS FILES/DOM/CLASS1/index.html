        //DOM-DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL-The Document Object Model (DOM) defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
        // DOM stands for Document Object Model. When the browser takes an HTML (XML) document, it creates the model. This model allows Javascript to access and manipulate HTML documents.


        //According to DOM, every HTML tag is an object, even the text inside a tag is an object as well. All data from those tags are saved as objects. Overall, everything is arranged as objects. The information in these objects is logically arranged as a data structure tree, known as the DOM tree.

        //Each browser has a program called DOM Parser. It is responsible for parsing an HTML document into DOM. It reads HTML and turns its data into objects that make up the DOM.

        //Advantages and Disadvantages of DOM-
        //Developers widely use DOM in Javascript. To build more responsive web pages, developers can also use other programming languages. With that said, letâ€™s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of DOM:
        //Advantages:

// DOM is language and platform-independent.
// It is traversable, which means since the data is arranged in a neat hierarchy model, developers find it easy to locate specific information.
// DOM is dynamic and customizable.
// The file is parsed only once.

//Disadvantages:

// DOM takes up more RAM.
// The operation speed is slow.
//To conclude, the DOM is a tree made up of all elements in an HTML document. Moreover, It is a set of Javascript objects with certain properties and characteristics.




        //console.log(document);--selects the whole document or webpage.
        //console.log(window.document)--selects the whole structure of html.
        //console.log(document.head)--selects the whole head part of the html
        //console.log(document.documentElement)--selects evry element in webpage.
       // console.log(document.body)--selects only the body part in the html page.
       //console.log(document.body.firstElementChild)--selects the the first element child in the body here in this case it is 'h1' tag.

       //let val=document.getElementById('part2id');
       //console.log(val.innerHTML);--will be able to load the whole the whole HTML and content.
       //innerText returns all text contained by an element and all its child elements.
       //console.log(val.innerText);--will be able to load all HTMLelents are removed and only text comes out as output.
       //innerHtml returns all text, including html tags, that is contained by an element.

       let val1=document.getElementsByClassName('tech')
       console.log(val1);
       console.log(val1[0].innerText) //Output-Javascript
       console.log(val1[1].innerText)  //Output-React
       val1[1].innerHTML='Kapil Sarkar'
       val1[2].innerText='<h1>My Name is Piku Sarkar</h1>'

       //BY TAG NAME

       const val2=document.getElementsByTagName('ul')
       console.log(val2)
        //BY TAG
        //QUERY SELECTOR-The Document method querySelector() returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors. If no matches are found, null is returned.

        let val3=document.querySelector('#newid').innerText
        console.log(val3)
       
        let val5=document.querySelector('p').style.backgroundColor='red'
