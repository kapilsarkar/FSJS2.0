//Objects in Javascript :
// Objects in javascript are one of the non-primitive datatypes which allow us to store multiple values in key-value pairs. These key-value pairs are known as properties. The key is also called as property name and the value is also called the property value.
//Objects are the most used data type in JavaScript.
//Objects make it easy to work with data.
//In simple words it can be said An object is a collection of data in the form of key-value pairs. Objects have keys and every key has a corresponding value. These values can be as simple as a number or string or maybe some complex types like function or even another object itself.
//Lets for example if we want to store name of cricketrs we will use array on thr other hand if we want to store name , matches played,runs scored by a cricketrs then object is used.

//Syntax for creating object :
//An object is created by first decalring the variable declaration then name of object after that = sign and curly {}.Here in this case an empty object is created.
//let us understand object by an example-
 const cricket = {
    name1:'Virat Kohli',
    matchesplayed:'100',
    runsscored:'2000',
    currentsataus: true
 };
 console.log(cricket);
