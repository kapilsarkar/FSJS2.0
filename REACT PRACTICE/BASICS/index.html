What Are The Major Features of React?
Before we look at why it is so popular, let us check out the React JS features properly. This will help us to understand how React JS works.

1. Virtual DOM⚛️
To understand the importance of React Virtual DOM, first, you need to know what DOM (Document Object Model) is🤫.

DOM is basically the representation of the HTML code in a webpage. The document is the webpage itself, the objects are the HTML tags. And finally, the model of DOM is a tree structure:

2. JavaScript XML or JSX📂
It is a markup syntax that describes the appearance of the interface of the app. It makes the syntax just like HTML and is used to create React components by developers.

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript used by React. JSX is basically used to write HTML tags inside JavaScript. Later, the JSX code will be translated into normal JavaScript.

In summary, React doesn’t have HTML files, HTML tags are rendered directly inside JavaScript. This approach makes React faster.

3. Component🗂️
Its applications work only after using the components. And each component has its own features. An App Build is made up of all these components.

4. One way data binding➡️
This feature helps more in controlling the app as it uses a unidirectional data flow or one-day data binding.

5.Simplicity😃
ReactJS is very easy to learn, it uses a JSX file which makes both application and coding very easy to use. Its reusable feature makes the code more easy.
